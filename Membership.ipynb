    "# Brahms membership sampling experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Brahms uses randomness to sample members, it can guarantee that peer's local view will not be poisened if f < 1/3. \n",
    "Each node has limited sending rate that can poison the view. \n",
    "\n",
    "At any time `t` peer keeps: \n",
    " - $N$ peer for communication \n",
    " - $S$ sample list: might have not defined nodes $\\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- The overlay constructed out of $N$ should be connected w.h.p \n",
    "- The sample after the churn should contain correct nodes and the probablitiy of selecting an honest node is uniform. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local sampling: choose set $S$ of nodes from the known ids\n",
    "- Gossip: exchange knowledge with other nodes = dynamic view $V$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node has inital $V$ - bootstrap set. $N$ is formed by merging $V$ and $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample(Element )-> output based on minwise pseudo-random function. Select random value over a stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain $l_2$ vector of `Sample` blocks, each id stream is an input for each sampler. \n",
    "Each sampled id is validated - pinged and reinitialized otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Gossip()\n",
    " 1. push - send id's to other nodes. Used to reinforce the knowledge of underpresneted nodes(newbies) \n",
    " 2. pull - retrive the view from other nodes. Used to spread existing knowledge \n",
    " \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a single round: issue $\\alpha*l_1$ pushes and $\\beta*l_1$ pulls.\n",
    "If more than some number of pushes is received it will be ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pushes must be contrained to portect from the targeted attack, while pulls must be constrained to protect rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Self healing \n",
    "\n",
    "History samples are considered for self-healing purposes. Direct history does not help, as it might be biased too. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "$l_1$ and $l_2$ = $\\Theta(\\sqrt[\\leftroot{-2}\\uproot{2}3]{N})$ is sufficent to gurantee good overlay w.h.p\n",
